            <h2>Meet the Founder</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm Sayesha Goel, a passionate animal lover and a student at Pathways School Gurgaon. My deep love for animals often turns into worry when I see so many species on the brink of extinction. This concern motivated me to take action and start this organization. I believe that every creature has the right to live safely and freely, and it is our responsibility to ensure that.</p>
    
    
       
            <h2>Why We Exist</h2>
            <p>Our organization was founded with the goal of spreading awareness about the laws in India that protect animals. Many people unknowingly commit acts that harm animals, unaware that such actions are illegal. By educating the public about these laws, we aim to reduce instances of animal cruelty and promote a more compassionate society.</p>
