        <h1>ANIMAL CRUELTY IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY</h1>
        <p>Do you know what all these have in common? All are made of animal skin. You might ask, â€œwhat is so shocking in that? Everyone wears them these days. But did you know that about 85% of the fashion industry uses the skin of captive animals at fur farms? A numberless list of Species including rabbits, minks, sheeps, cows, foxes, raccoon dogs, snakes, pigs, birds, crocodiles are bred and slaughtered for their fur each day. Using animals for fashion is a grave issue and as responsible citizens, I implore that helping these innocent beings is the need of the hour.

        <h1>HABITAT LOSS</h1>
        <p>There are about 7.95 billion people living in this world, who share about 7.68 billion acres of land. This leaves approximately 1 acre of land per person, and the rest belongs to the animals. However, with the population increasing at such a high rate, global hunger is compelled to accompany it. More than 820 million people are hungry globally. Due to this, governments are compelled to convert the land owned by the animals to agricultural land in order to produce more crops so that everyone is able to consume sufficient amounts of food. 
            Additionally, habitat loss is also a cause of urbanization which is the act of cutting trees to build new homes. Because of it , we have to convert the forest land into residential areas.

        <h1>ANIMAL TESTING</h1>
        <p>Have you ever been in a situation where you go shopping with your mom, and you really want to buy a cool t-shirt.but she refuses and instead buys you a boring shirt? How do you feel at that time? Is it powerless, suppressed and frustrated, because your right to wear what you want has been snatched from you, and someone else is deciding for you? animals go through the same feeling everyday! Although, we are not making their wardrobe choices for them but something worse: we are deciding their fate.</p>
